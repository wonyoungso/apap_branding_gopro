API for controlling GoPro Hero 3 Camera from Node.js.

The initial mission here is to take, retrieve, and remove timelapse photos with/from the camera.

As there is no public API, this work is based on these reverse engineering efforts:

### Issues

- The status bytes at least as given by my Hero3 White are totally unknown. The status() method assumes that byte 15 is ready status.

### Usage

```javascript
  var Camera = require('gopro').Camera
  var cam = new Camera('10.5.5.9', 'camera password')
  
  cam.startCapture()
  .then(function() {
    cam.stopCapture()
  })
```
